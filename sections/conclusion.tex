\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I proposed QAOA formulation for the joint RWA problem.
    \item The encoding uses one-hot constraints and a tailored mixer to guarantee feasibility.
    \item The joint formulation outperforms the two-step scheme.
    \item At small scales ($\leq 27$ qubits), QAOA underperforms classical heuristics in blocking.
\item Smarter cost-function shaping and adaptive mixers may improve performance.

\item Larger quantum hardware ($> 27$ qubits) will be needed to test the formulation at meaningful scales.
    \end{itemize}
